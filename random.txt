That my days have been a dream;
While I weep--while I weep!
All that we see or seem
In a vision, or in none,
You are not wrong, who deem
But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not grasp
Is all that we see or seem
While I weep--while I weep!
In a night, or in a day,
You are not wrong, who deem
O God! can I not grasp
And I hold within my hand
