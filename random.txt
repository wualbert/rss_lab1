How few! yet how they creep
Them with a tighter clasp?
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Grains of the golden sand--
Is all that we see or seem
Is all that we see or seem
And I hold within my hand
O God! can I not save
Through my fingers to the deep,
Through my fingers to the deep,
One from the pitiless wave?
Yet if hope has flown away
And, in parting from you now,
Is all that we see or seem
And, in parting from you now,
O God! can I not grasp
I stand amid the roar
And, in parting from you now,
All that we see or seem

Take this kiss upon the brow!
O God! can I not save
Take this kiss upon the brow!
