And I hold within my hand
That my days have been a dream;
Is all that we see or seem
And, in parting from you now,
But a dream within a dream?While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not save
All that we see or seem
One from the pitiless wave?
You are not wrong, who deem
In a vision, or in none,
I stand amid the roar
How few! yet how they creep
You are not wrong, who deem
You are not wrong, who deem
Thus much let me avow--
