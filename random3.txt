But a dream within a dream?That my days have been a dream;
But a dream within a dream?Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Is all that we see or seem
All that we see or seem
I stand amid the roar
That my days have been a dream;
And, in parting from you now,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And, in parting from you now,
Is but a dream within a dream.
O God! can I not grasp
Is all that we see or seem
O God! can I not save
In a vision, or in none,
